- This is crosstool-ng 1.20.x, because that was the newest that supported gcc 4.4.x and linux 
  26.27.x kernel headers.
- I needed additional dependencies:
  sudo apt-get install gperf
- Steps taken to re-build the i686-dynon-linux-gnu configuration, based on the old one:
  - Copy in files from old SVN sdk/crosstool-ng/samples/i686-dynon-linux-gnu
  - 
- Build steps (from checkout):
  ./bootstrap
  .configure --enable-local
  make
  make install
  ./ct-ng i686-dynon-linux-gnu
  ./ct-ng build
